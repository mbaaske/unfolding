# Description
Stereological unfolding the joint size-shape-orientation distribution of spheroidal shaped particles

# Abstract
Stereological unfolding as implemented in this package consists in the estimation of the joint size-
shape-orientation distribution of spheroidal shaped particles based on the same measured quantities
of corresponding planar section profiles. A single trivariate discretized version of the (stereological)
integral equation in the case of prolate and oblate spheroids is solved numerically by the EM algo-
rithm. The estimation of diameter distribution of spheres from planar sections (Wicksellâ€™s corpuscle
problem) is also implemented. Further, the package provides routines for the simulation of a Pois-
son germ- grain process with either spheroids, spherocylinders or spheres as grains together with
functions for planar sections. For the purpose of exact simulation a bivariate size-shape distribution
is implemented.
